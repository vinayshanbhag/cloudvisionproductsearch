# Product search using Google Cloud Vision

Google Vision API Product Search allows retailers to create products, each containing reference images that visually describe the product from a set of viewpoints. Retailers can then add these products to product sets. 

When users query the product set with their own images, Vision API Product Search applies machine learning to compare the product in the user's query image with the images in the retailer's product set, and then returns a ranked list of visually and semantically similar results.
